# Flutter Android App

This repository contains a Flutter-based Android application project. I created this project using the **Cursor IDE** to upload and organize the files. I believe in being fully transparent: I do not know Dart yet — this project is part of my learning process, and I plan to build solid Dart skills as I develop more Flutter apps.

I also want to make it clear that I do **not** rely entirely on AI for my coding. I write my own code too, and use AI tools only where they genuinely help streamline parts of the workflow.

## How to Set Up

If you’d like to run this project or build on top of it, here’s how to get started:

1. **Install Flutter**

   Follow the official instructions: [https://flutter.dev/](https://flutter.dev/)

   Verify your setup:

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Install Android Studio**

   For a complete development environment: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

   Ensure you have the Android SDK and an emulator or physical device ready.

3. **Create a New Flutter Project**

   In your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter create your_project_name
   ```

4. **Replace Files**

   Replace the generated `android/`, `lib/`, `test/` folders and the `pubspec.yaml` with the ones from this repository.

5. **Get Dependencies**

   Run:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

6. **Run the App**

   Finally, launch the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## About This Project

This project reflects my practical approach — setting things up hands-on, learning new stacks step by step, and being transparent about my current skill set and goals.
